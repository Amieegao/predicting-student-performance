During this simulation, I successfully used Git to manage Scrum artifacts like the product backlog, sprint backlog, and user stories. The branching and commit structure helped organize tasks clearly. One thing that went well was the integration of Markdown files with Git commits, which made tracking progress intuitive. However, I encountered issues with remote setup and push conflicts, which I’ll aim to resolve faster next sprint. Git and Scrum together provided a structured workflow for data science, balancing flexibility with traceability. This approach made it easier to iterate and reflect on deliverables.
