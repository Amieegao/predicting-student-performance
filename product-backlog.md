# 🧠 Product Backlog – Predicting Student Performance

## Project Goal
Build a model to predict student performance and analyze key influencing factors.

## Backlog Items

1. Collect student performance dataset (e.g., from UCI or Kaggle)
2. Clean the data (handle missing values, outliers)
3. Perform feature engineering (select variables like study time, family background)
4. Build predictive models (e.g., linear regression, random forest)
5. Evaluate model accuracy (using RMSE, R², etc.)
6. Create visualizations (e.g., scores vs. study time)
7. Write analysis report (summarize findings and recommendations)
